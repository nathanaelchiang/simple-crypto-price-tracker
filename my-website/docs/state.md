# State Management Explanation

Managing state efficiently is critical in modern web applications to ensure a responsive UI, minimize redundant data fetching, and simplify the codebase. In this project, we have chosen to utilize **React Query**, **Zustand**, and the **Context API** for state management, each serving specific purposes.

## React Query

**Purpose:**  
- **Remote Data Management:** Handles asynchronous data fetching, caching, and updates from external APIs.
- **Automatic Updates:** Supports background re-fetching with configurable intervals.
- **Error Handling:** Simplifies error management with built-in support for retries and status indicators.

**Why React Query?**  
- **Optimized Performance:** Minimizes unnecessary re-fetches by caching responses.
- **Simplicity:** Offers an easy-to-use API to manage server state with minimal boilerplate.
- **Resilience:** Improves user experience by gracefully handling loading states and errors.

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  }
  return response.json();
};

const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['apiData'], fetchData, {
  refetchInterval: 60000, // Refresh data every 60 seconds
});
